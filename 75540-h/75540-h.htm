  <p>Comparatively little has been written in English on Pieter Bruegel

    the request of the artists <cite class="smcap">The Arts</cite> undertook to supply this
    want. In selecting Mr. Barker to carry out this important work <span class="smcap">The
    Arts</span> was particularly fortunate. Besides being an ardent student
    of the genius of Bruegel, the author, in the course of his duties as
    European correspondent of <cite class="smcap">The Arts</cite>, was able to carry on the
    special research necessary to give permanent value to the following

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap2">Aside</span> from the evidence of the signed and frequently dated prints,
    drawings and paintings, few things are certainly known about the life
    and personality of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Almost all of these,
    such as they are, occur in a brief passage concerning him, written
    about thirty years after his death, in “The Book of the Painters” by
    Carel Van Mander. Herein is no mention of the date of Bruegel’s birth;
    even the place of it, despite a seeming definiteness, remains in some
    obscurity. His biographer says that the painter was born “not far from
    Breda, in a village called Breughel,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> by which name he called himself
    and left it to his descendants.” The village of that name nearest to
    Breda is twenty-five miles away; and as distances went in the sixteenth
    century, this seems hardly to be bridged by Van Mander’s easy phrase.
    As for the year, the guesses of the scholars range all the way from
    1510 to 1530, the most widely accepted one being 1525. Any closer
    determination of it is a matter of comparative unimportance in its
    possible effect on the period of actual productiveness, since this is
    very satisfactorily covered by trustworthy dates.</p>

  <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> There are several different ways of spelling this name,
    each having some degree of authority; but so far as concerns the
    painter himself, the deciding fact is that the signatures now visible
    on the paintings (about twenty in number) consistently adhere to
    BRVEGEL.</div>

  <p>And whatever the exact year may have been, it had not been long before
    when for Europeans the geographical world had been suddenly enlarged
    as a sort of materialization of the immediately preceding enlargement
    of mind. The succession of discoveries—of America; of India and the
    true Indies; of Sumatra, Java and Borneo; and, two hundred and fifty
    years after Marco Polo, of China—were only the working on another
    plane of the essentially exploring spirit which had been previously
    manifested by the scholars, scientists and artists of the Early
    Renaissance. National unity on a fresh basis had been realized in Spain
    through the expulsion of the Moors, and in both France and England
    under absolute monarchies which were headed, at the time of Bruegel’s
    birth, by Francis <abbr title="first">I</abbr> and Henry <abbr title="eighth">VIII</abbr>. About that time, also, Magellan
    was circumnavigating the globe and Cortez was conquering Mexico;
    Leonardo and Raphael were dying, and shortly after them went Carpaccio,
    Leo <abbr title="tenth">X</abbr> and Signorelli. Martin Luther, preaching the Reformation in
    Germany, was thus initiating a movement of ruinous significance for
    Bruegel’s homeland; for there the cause of religious liberty, gradually
    coalescing with that of political independence, was to meet with the
    terrible repressions begun by the newly elected Emperor, Charles Quint,
    who was already by inheritance lord of the Low Countries.</p>

  <p>During all this period of ferment and reorientation for the European
    mind, Antwerp, where Bruegel was to spend most of his life, was one of
    the most important of all ports. Situated in what was then the most
    densely populated region of Europe, it had in its own houses a hundred
    thousand persons; and of these more than a tenth were foreigners—German
    merchants, Italian scholars, Portuguese Jews, French Huguenots, English
    sailors and the soldiers of Spain. Far-journeyed vessels brought to
    it the spices and rich stuffs, the metal-work and strange animals
    of distant lands; and their seamen had tales to tell of things far
    off towards the expanding horizons of the world. In this comfortable
    and prosperous city, where the sharp demarcations between classes
    prevalent in other countries were blurred almost into a real democracy
    of the bourgeois, every fresh discovery and important event had its
    repercussion in the general consciousness.</p>

  <p>Antwerp was thus a natural center of activity for the religious
    propaganda and disputation which formed so large and so tragic an
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>element in the life of the sixteenth century; creeds of all sorts
    readily found adherents among its varied and impressionable populace.
    Lutheranism was so strongly advocated by the convent of Augustinian
    monks that its inmates were dispersed, after the execution of two
    among them, and its buildings razed. Though the terrorism of the
    Inquisitor Van der Hulst and his priestly successors imposed silence
    on many, there were open preachings as well as clandestine meetings,
    and riots in which religion-frenzied women were among the boldest; and
    with all the burnings of the books, with all the imprisonments and
    the brandings, the full penalties of the imperial edicts could hardly
    be enforced by those who were conscious that such enforcement would
    destroy the principal source of the Emperor’s precarious revenue.
    Even the anarchy of Anabaptism, persecuted by Catholic and Protestant
    alike, made headway through the martyrdom of its believers; and from
    1544, almost the very year when the young Pieter Bruegel commenced his
    apprenticeship, the new sectarianism of Calvin entered the city and
    grew rapidly in strength.</p>

  <p>While he was growing up, the English and the French were subduing
    the North American continent and in the Andes Pizarro was rifling
    the wealth of Peru; Rome was being pillaged by the Germans; Henry
    <abbr title="eighth">VIII</abbr> was finally repudiating Catholicism and Ignatius of Loyola was
    in a way belatedly replying to Luther by organizing the Society of
    Jesuits; Hampton Court Palace, the French chateaux and the palaces of
    Venice were being built; Erasmus, Dürer, Machiavelli, Luini, Ariosto,
    Correggio died. As yet unconscious <span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>of such events and such personages,
    perhaps ignorant of the nearer deaths of Quentin Matsys and Lucas
    van Leyden, the youth of nameless family was living a peasant among
    peasants—and a genius in the making—sharing to full their laborious,
    roistering life. Hard drinkers and heavy eaters, they were much given
    to feasts and fairs; marriages, baptisms, even deaths were for them
    occasions for celebrations as excessive as the labor from which they
    thus escaped. Their animal frankness and coarse gaiety blew like a
    gale of rude health over all their activities. From life itself, from
    the small events in a remote village of the <em>Campine</em>, Bruegel
    absorbed the great sane grossness which now seems buried in the books
    of his day. Bringing with him the peasant vitality which was to develop
    into a lofty philosophic humaneness, he came to Antwerp and, a youth
    approaching his twentieth year, became an apprentice to the celebrated
    Pieter Coeck. Paracelsus, Copernicus and Holbein had just died; Bruegel
    had hardly learned to grind his colors when French Francis and English
    Henry followed them, even as their sometime enemy, sometime ally,
    Charles, was bloodily but only temporarily settling religious questions
    at Mühlberg.</p>

    <figcaption>THE LAST JUDGMENT (DRAWING). &nbsp; &nbsp;1558. &nbsp; &nbsp;VIENNA, ALBERTINA</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>From his first master Bruegel must have received somewhat more than a
    merely technical training, good as that probably was. Coeck had been
    for four years the pupil of Bernard van Orley and had later studied
    in Rome; in his own work afterwards he relied to such an extent upon
    the formulas then worked out that all of it now seems borrowed; but
    the precepts that he would pass <span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>on to an apprentice could not dull or
    conventionalize so forceful a nature as Bruegel’s. Of more significance
    in the development of such a nature must have been the stories of far
    countries that were told, adding to his knowledge and stimulating his
    imagination; for Coeck had spent the year of 1533 in the Constantinople
    of Suleiman the Magnificent and had been one of the <em>entourage</em>
    of Charles on his expedition to Tunis in 1538. Painter to the Emperor
    and Dean of the Guild of Saint Luke, Pieter Coeck died in 1550. Then or
    before Bruegel passed over to the work-shop of Jerome Cock, who was not
    so much a painter as a dealer in pictures and a publisher of popular
    prints. His establishment “was certainly the rendezvous of all the
    artists and all the amateurs of Antwerp and even from abroad. Rendered
    in engraving, the greater number of existing masterpieces would pass
    under the eyes of the attentive Bruegel.” (Bernard: <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 58.) The very
    shop-name, “At the Sign of the Four Winds,” symbolized the range of
    influences that played over him, the sights and tales that passed into
    his consciousness; and for Bruegel these things could be only so many
    more incitements to journey into the world and see it all for himself.</p>

  <p>Therefore it is not surprising that, after he had completed his
    apprenticeship and been received into the painter’s guild, in 1551,
    he should set out upon his travels. Such a trip in those days was no
    light undertaking. All <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>frontiers were insecure since the wars between
    Charles and Francis for continental domination; for little or nothing
    soldiers turned into robbers. Van Mander mentions neither routes nor
    places, writing only that Bruegel “went into France and from there into
    Italy.” Even the drawings now preserved afford no positive information
    as to the way he went—a circumstance which might be interpreted to
    mean that already he was interested less in telling what a specific
    place looked like than in rendering the emotional effect of nature
    upon himself. But two designs now preserved as etchings are signed
    and dated at Rome in 1553, and there is a drawing of the Ripa Grande
    which appears to have been done on the spot. The print of a naval
    battle engraved by Huys and published by Cock after Bruegel’s return to
    Antwerp indicates that he went as far south as Messina.</p>

  <p>When he passed through France, François Clouet and Germain Pilon were
    practising their art of tepid grace; when he reached Rome, the Sistine
    Chapel paintings had been completed, but not the church of Saint Peter.
    At the height of their working powers were Michelangelo, Titian,
    Palestrina, Palladio; and Benvenuto Cellini was doubling in the roles
    of artist and bandit. There is no proof that Bruegel had any contact
    with these men; that he even saw their works is recorded neither in
    words nor in the paintings by which he lives today in their company.
    It is certainly reasonable, however, to suppose that the fame of his
    contemporaries had not only reached him but actually played a part in
    persuading him to his long wayfaring. Though still in his twenties, he
    even then had sufficiently a mind of his own to avoid the mistake of
    his predecessors, who had gone south specifically to copy and imitate
    the styles of the Italian painters. In their journeying they were
    following a fashion, doing something because others were doing it;
    Bruegel’s urge was both deeper and broader, as his genius was.</p>

  <p>Yes, the artistic, the professional, motive must have had much to do
    with sending him to Italy, but the only way of expressing the sum total
    of the desires that undoubtedly <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>animated him is to say that he must
    have craved more life.</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“For to admire an’ for to see,</div>
        <div class="i1">For to be’old this world so wide”—</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">no motive less comprehensive than this could have moved him. He was a
    great artist in the making, but he was even more a man than an artist;
    for him the art of other men could be only a part, and not the most
    important part, of the all-inclusive experience of which he was in
    search. Only such a conception of his personality can account for the
    failure of the Italian masterpieces to influence him then or thereafter
    and his own immediate and life-long preoccupation with the entire range
    of nature and of human life. Moreover, so much can be inferred from Van
    Mander’s only other reference to this momentous trip, a reference which
    takes the form of reporting somebody else’s remark that “... in the
    Alps he swallowed all the rocks and mountains, to return home and vomit

  <p class="drop-cap-s"><span class="smcap1">Towards</span> the end of 1553, not long after the deaths of Rabelais and
    Lucas Cranach, Bruegel was back in Antwerp. He again became affiliated
    with the shop of Jerome Cock, but now as a sort of collaborator, making
    drawings for many plates to be engraved by others and published by the
    shop. As a successful business man with an eye to the market, Cock’s
    specialties were landscapes of all types and grotesqueries in the
    manner of Jerome Bosch, dead thirty-five years before, whose works were
    a mine of motives for exploitation. The former apprentice proved to be
    an even greater source of revenue and popularity for “The Four Winds”;
    he shared completely in the contemporary taste served by the shop and
    for several years devoted himself entirely to new and increasingly
    inventive compositions in each <em>genre</em>.</p>

  <p>The pure landscapes of this period fall into two very distinct
    divisions—the small, intimate ones and the large, composite ones.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a><a id="Page_14"></a><a id="Page_15"></a>15</span>Among the first sort those of such obviously picturesque things as
    ruins are less interesting, seem less realized, than those depicting
    the homely commonplaces characteristic of the Low Countries. An
    indefinite and puddled village street, a church set among trees,
    the hybrid ruralness where town and country meet—the buildings
    and small figures rendered in a clean, unwavering line and the
    massed multitude of leaves given without a superfluous or unmeaning
    scribble—these things, conveyed with such immediacy by the free and
    sensitive pen-work, become sharp-edged and lose their bloom through
    the interposition of the engraver’s hand. Though his return gave him
    to see all the littlenesses about him with the freshness of a first
    encounter, it did not make him forget the mountains which had struck
    so deeply into his mind; and he composed a whole series of large,
    Latin-titled designs in which the far and low horizons of home were
    fabulously combined with Alpine steeps. In these plates, deeper than
    the romanticism of their composite character, is an immense and sober
    poetry which transpires even through the hardness of the engraving.</p>

  <p>One print, dated the very year of his return, a composition of many
    people skating just outside a city wall, is obviously based on direct
    observation and is Bruegel’s first essay in the realistic rendering
    of the life of crowds which was later to play so large a part in his
    painting; but yet awhile the greater part of his labor went into a long
    succession of drolleries and diabolisms.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>It is in connection with this part, and this part only, of his
    life-work that there arises any necessity of discussing the influence
    of another painter on Bruegel. Van Mander <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a><a id="Page_17"></a><a id="Page_18"></a>18</span>treats the matter thus:
    “He practised much in the manner of Jerome Bosch and used to make many
    such goblin pictures and drolleries, for which he was called by many
    <em>Pieter the Droll</em>.” The biographer here recorded the general
    contemporary estimate which, though it is now seen to fall far short
    of the truth, was surely natural enough, since in his own day Bruegel
    was popularly known by the widely circulated prints rather than by
    the unreproduced paintings. The <a href="#i_08"><cite>Big and Little Fish</cite></a> of 1556
    is directly from Bosch, and that his spirit and his manner did have
    an influence upon Bruegel is not to be denied. But such influence as
    Bosch did exert upon the man who had returned from Italy uninfluenced
    was possible only because they shared in a racial streak which can be
    traced back of them into the Middle Ages. The quality that allowed
    Bruegel to be influenced by Bosch at all would have manifested
    itself in Bruegel’s art even if Bosch had never lived. Moreover,
    Bosch’s art was limited almost to this one type of subject-matter,
    whereas Bruegel’s art soon developed other and far more important
    characteristics which overshadowed without obliterating this element of
    grotesquerie.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>For the time being, however, it had free rein in a series of
    <cite>Vices</cite> and numerous separate plates such as <cite>The Ass
    at School</cite>, <cite>The Sorcerer</cite>, <cite>The Merchant Robbed by
    Monkeys</cite>. In these prints there are, in addition, a mastery of
    design, an inventiveness of detail and a convincingness of outlandish
    imagination that far surpass Bosch’s most ambitious efforts. A little
    of these qualities is to be discerned in the two drawings of <a href="#i_09"><cite>The
    Last Judgment</cite></a> and <a href="#i_15"><cite>Christ in Limbo</cite></a>; and they also display
    Bruegel’s entire lack of any mystical <span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>fervor, which would have
    imparted some sort of impressiveness to his Christs. This negative
    trait in Bruegel, which is the exact obverse of the sort of humaneness
    which made him great, is further shown in the series of <cite>Virtues</cite>,
    also of this period; although these occasionally exhibit a high degree
    of skill in handling complex groupings, they are what professionalized
    virtues are apt to be—tedious.</p>

  <p>Midway in this prosperous and fertile time of development the Emperor
    Charles, taken with the notion of enjoying all the benefits of being
    dead while yet alive, partitioned the empire between his brother and
    his son, and himself retired in state to a monastery in Spain. From
    this haven, free of governmental responsibilities, he was able, through
    his dutiful son Philip, to instigate increasingly severe measures of
    religious and political repression for the people of the northern
    lowlands. Yet such things did not affect the personal liberty of
    Bruegel, who was maintaining an irregular establishment described by
    Van Mander in the following anecdote: “As long as he lived in Antwerp,
    he kept house with a servant-girl, whom he might have married had it
    not misfortuned him that she was always telling lies, a thing repugnant
    to his love of truth. He made an agreement or contract with her that he
    should mark all her lies on a stick—and he took a pretty long one—and
    when the stick should be full of marks the marriage should be off;
    which then happened before much time had passed.”</p>

  </figure>

  <p>More important is what Van Mander tells us of a friendship: “He worked
    much for a merchant named Hans Frankert, an admirable and excellent
    man, who found pleasure in knowing Bruegel and was with him whole
    days at a time. With this man Frankert, Bruegel often went among the
    peasants, to fairs and marriages, both dressed like peasants; and they
    took presents like the others, just as if they belonged to the family
    or acquaintance of the bride or the bridegroom. Here Bruegel found his
    pleasure in observing the manners of the peasants in eating, drinking,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>dancing, jumping, loving and other fun-making; which things he then
    very skilfully and carefully rendered again in colors, in water-color
    as well as in oil, in both which mediums he was extraordinarily
    talented.” Then Van Mander proceeds to stress the faithfulness and
    accuracy of Bruegel’s peasant pictures in the details of costumes and
    movements. In short, Bruegel had begun to paint.</p>

  <p>The earliest dated painting, <a href="#i_16"><cite>Twelve Flemish Proverbs</cite></a>, is
    interesting only because of its connection with Bruegel; its relative
    clumsiness of execution and utterly unpictorial conception as a whole
    render it very likely the first of his attempts in a new medium.
    However, this picture and the others that must be grouped immediately
    with it mark the definite emergence of what was thenceforward to be his
    predominant interest—the life of the peasants, between whom and himself
    there existed the unbreakable bonds of a common origin and a common
    destiny. Thus he began at once to paint in accordance with the dictates
    of his essentially realistic genius, but the first works of capital
    importance still retain a large admixture of the fantastic spirit
    which had been running riot in his recent designs for the engravings.
    These two pictures are the <a href="#i_13"><cite>Carnival and Lent</cite></a> and the <a href="#i_16"><cite>Flemish
    Proverbs</cite></a> in Berlin, both of the year 1559; in both fantasy is made
    convincing through realistic treatment, just as the Van Eycks and Roger
    Van der Weyden had made convincing their religious idealism, Bruegel’s
    difference from them being simply a difference of subject-matter and
    a still greater reliance upon realistic skill for its own sake. In
    the <a href="#i_17"><cite>Children’s Games</cite></a> of the next year there occurs the first
    complete union on a great scale of realism in both matter and manner;
    and two years later, with the <a href="#i_18"><cite>Fall of the Rebel Angels</cite></a>, a
    recurrence in greatly intensified form of the combination between
    fantastic idea and realistic treatment. This last painting, credited
    to Jerome Bosch himself until the discovery of Bruegel’s signature,
    is infinitely superior in conception and execution to anything by the
    earlier man, and would alone rank its creator as a great painter; yet
    the greatness it confers upon its maker is not the kind that is most
    truly Bruegel’s. Through <span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>all these paintings of the Antwerp period
    there runs a rapidly increasing technical skill—in drawing, color and
    design—until the last picture that could possibly have been done before
    his removal to Brussels, the <a href="#i_19"><cite>Israelites and Philistines</cite></a>, is for
    minute workmanship a world’s wonder. On a small panel about thirteen
    by twenty-two inches Bruegel has put several hundred human beings, the
    largest of whom is less than two and one-half inches, in a landscape
    setting of great beauty, all done in such detail that one can count
    the spots on the giraffes far away across the river—and all seen with
    so careful a regard for values and design that it is a satisfactory
    picture from whatever distance it is regarded, its details merging into
    the larger relations as one views it from further off. Craftsmanship of
    this type in painting can go no farther.</p>

  <h3>3.</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> cause of his leaving Antwerp was his marriage, which took place
    in 1563. His choice had fallen upon the daughter of his first master,
    Pieter Coeck. Twice during his brief notice on Bruegel, Van Mander
    refers to the fact that “he had, while she was still small, often
    carried her in his arms.” Her mother, after the father’s death,
    had removed to Brussels and there successfully engaged in her own
    profession of miniature painting; in consenting to the marriage she
    “stipulated that Bruegel should leave Antwerp and settle down in
    Brussels, in order that he might efface former love-affairs from his
    eyes and his mind.” In this marriage was the beginning of what has
    been well called the Bruegel dynasty. The two sons produced copies and
    variations of their father’s paintings in such abundance that it is an
    exceptional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a><a id="Page_23"></a><a id="Page_24"></a><a id="Page_25"></a><a id="Page_26"></a><a id="Page_27"></a>27</span>
    picture gallery in Europe which does not boast its
    “<i lang="fr">Breughel le Vieux</i>”; and these sons in their turn fathered a
    dozen more painters.</p>

  <p>But of them all, none approached the greatness of their original,

  <p>While he was achieving all this ordered beauty of art, the disorders of
    the life around him were increasing at a fatally rapid pace. In Ghent
    a mob sacked the Abbey of Saint Peter and, made drunk by the wine of
    its cellars and the intoxication of destructiveness, ran smashingly
    at large through the city. In Antwerp another mob totally destroyed
    the rich and famous church of <em>Notre Dame</em>. Conflicts multiplied
    between Catholics and Protestants, between civilians and soldiers;
    bands of foreign mercenaries coursed through the country and open
    towns. The Duke of Alva’s execution fires cast lurid lights upon the
    ruin and decimation of what had once <span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>been the most prosperous region
    of Europe.</p>

  <p>Of Bruegel’s own reactions to all this his biographer, writing at a
    time when it was almost a well-forgotten nightmare, makes no mention.
    Van Mander’s single sentence of direct characterization is this: “He
    was a very quiet and skilful man, who spoke little but was sociable
    in society, and loved to frighten his companions, often also his own
    pupils, with all kinds of goblin noises....” This does little to round
    out the portrait of Bruegel the man, for once more the emphasis is
    thrown upon that droll and amusing side of his nature which seems to
    have appealed most to his own circle and thence been transmitted to Van
    Mander. But that Bruegel was intensely aware of the tragedies about
    him is evident enough in his works. The things he saw for himself are
    set down in such pictures as the <a href="#i_33"><cite>Massacre of the Innocents</cite></a>, yet
    with such an all-sufficing objectiveness that it requires an effort of
    mind to realize that that very convincingness comes from his having
    felt the tragic reality he records. But it is impossible to escape
    from the overwhelmingly personal quality of the thoughts set forth in
    the hell-mouth horrors of the <a href="#i_21"><cite>Dulle Griet</cite></a> and the apocalyptic
    terrors of the <a href="#i_29"><cite>Triumph of Death</cite></a>. Moreover, Van Mander writes
    that Bruegel had made many other “inventions” which were “so satirical
    and mordant that on his death-bed he ordered them burnt by his wife,
    either from repentance or from fear that his wife would get into
    trouble on account of them.”</p>

  <p>Not many months before this happened <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a><a id="Page_30"></a>30</span>the people of the Low Countries
    commenced their final effort of revolt which was to establish their
    freedom not until eleven years later. Bruegel left a world that was
    hardly less black than the death into which he descended with open
    eyes. At that very moment Montaigne was setting about to depict one
    entire man with a vision as veracious as that of Bruegel; Cervantes was
    soon to rival in words Bruegel’s power of making the fantastic real;
    and only forty years later Shakespeare was to accomplish a re-creation
    of human life that is more complete than Bruegel’s simply because the
    medium of literature itself permits a more comprehensive embodiment
    of the soul of man than is possible to the medium of paint. And the
    painter who more than any other kept close to life belongs in the
    company of these three.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap-s"><span class="smcap1">The</span> subject-matter of Bruegel’s great paintings is limited only by the
    world and life.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The whole cycle of nature is in them—the seasons as
    they pass over mountain, plain and moving waters; the dazzling beauty
    of the southern sea, the northern cold. The entire range of human life
    is in them; somewhere in these multitudes every emotion finds its
    expressive gesture. Even all the animals that are intimately a part of
    human life are given in their degrees of individuality. These pictures
    seem to set before the eye every experience possible to man.</p>

  <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> The succeeding remarks upon Bruegel’s art and mind,
    disregarding both the minor and the debatable works, are based
    specifically upon the paintings which are characteristically great.</div>

  <p>Always a tale is being told, but always it is story-telling of a
    very definite kind. It is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>never a continuous narrative with a plot
    involving the same characters in different circumstances. Thus Bruegel
    was never obliged to arrange successive episodes of the same story
    within one frame, as the older painters had done. All the things that
    happen in his paintings could happen—do happen—just as he shows them,
    at the same time and in just the relationship to each other that he
    depicts. He always observes time unity and pulls together his wealth of
    episode and by-play through unity of theme.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter illowp90" id="i_31">
    <img src="images/i_31.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>THE TRIUMPH OF DEATH (DETAIL)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>But on a given theme, at first, he attempted to say everything than
    can be said about it. The picture in Berlin illustrates seventy
    proverbs; the <a href="#i_17"><cite>Children’s Games</cite></a> is said to contain every one of
    the one hundred and fifty-four varieties of play listed by Rabelais
    as the games of Gargantua; the <a href="#i_22"><cite>Tower of Babel</cite></a> has been called
    a builders’ handbook; the <a href="#i_33"><cite>Massacre of the Innocents</cite></a> apparently
    depicts every possible attitude of parental grief and frenzy. This
    exuberance of episode, this encyclopedic narrative utterance, had its
    literary counterpart in the book just mentioned; it was in full accord
    with the taste of the time, and Bruegel’s personal aptitude had been
    fostered and disciplined by his long succession of drawings for the
    plates published by Cock. For the paintings of this type he has thought
    out every possible visual aspect of his story-matter and swept them all
    into a unity of design not less remarkable than his unity of theme.</p>

  <p>The astounding thing to be noted just here is the completeness with
    which such an excessive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a><a id="Page_33"></a><a id="Page_34"></a>34</span> amount of anecdote is arranged into a
    functioning organism of narrative. In the <a href="#i_23"><cite>Carrying of the Cross</cite></a>
    the movement of every one of the five hundred figures, the very
    expression of every face, is determined by a completely organized
    story-action. All the figures, even the minutest ones, play their
    parts in the whole design as such; but their momentary relations as
    human beings, equally complex, have been thought out and set down with
    equal thoroughness. Every episode is a bar, every gesture a note, in
    Bruegel’s orchestrated narrative.</p>

    <figcaption>THE MASSACRE OF THE INNOCENTS (DETAIL)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>But other paintings show that Bruegel realized the fundamental weakness
    of this—the weakness of diversity of visual motive, distraction from
    the pictorial whole. He exhibited a tendency towards the elimination
    of all side-play, towards the reduction of subject-matter to a single
    motive and a reliance upon emotional unity for the abiding impression.
    His picture-making is still story-telling in that something happens
    in terms of human action; but it is a single and casual event, and
    the main interest is shifted from events to design and color as the
    expression of mood. In the <a href="#i_48"><cite>Months</cite></a> he forgot all about narrative
    complexity for its own sake, fixed his attention on the pure pictorial
    beauty of people and of nature, and sought only the emotional meaning

  <p>In the earlier pictures color in general is <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a><a id="Page_36"></a><a id="Page_37"></a><a id="Page_38"></a>38</span>conceived somewhat as
    the worker in mosaic is compelled by his material to conceive it—as a
    weaving-together of brilliant bits of pure color into a color design
    which is itself thought out independently of other technical qualities.
    There is harmony and richness, but there is not that melting tonality
    which afterwards came to be looked upon as the last word in painting.
    Above all else, there is an unbelievable brilliancy, especially where
    Bruegel made a lavish use of vermilion. The chain of soldiers woven
    through the multitude in the <a href="#i_23"><cite>Carrying of the Cross</cite></a> is one
    of the most daring things to be found in painting; but for general
    sumptuousness of color approaching to the fusion of later times there
    is, outside of the <a href="#i_48"><cite>Months</cite></a>, no equal in Bruegel’s work to the
    <a href="#i_37"><cite>Conversion of Paul</cite></a>. And always it is color used for its own
    sake, with great sensuous delight. Yet always, again excepting the
    <a href="#i_48"><cite>Months</cite></a>, it is color laid on to form which has already been
    conceived as drawing; the color, superb in itself, follows the form
    superbly; but the color and the drawing exist independently of one
    another.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of his painting career it was his drawing especially
    which was determined by his work for the engravers. For the masculine
    style of engraving that prevailed in his day the preparatory drawings
    had to show absolute precision of outline. The edges of everything
    had to be clean and unmistakable in order that the engraver might
    know what was intended; the artist of the first instance had to make
    it impossible for the engraver to mistake his meaning as to this
    contour or that shape. Drawing in this manner for years before he
    began to paint, Bruegel necessarily continued to do so afterwards.
    This accounts for the prevailingly silhouette character of his
    multitudes of tiny figures. Often-times, even from the beginning, the
    form that meets the eye within the shape is substantially filled out
    without being accompanied by the feeling of all-aroundness; but a
    full three-dimensional quality is more and more often attained until
    in the <a href="#i_37"></a>Paul</cite><cite>, again, it fills the picture to a degree elsewhere
    unequalled in Bruegel’s work.</p>

  <p>But another consequence of his early professional training—and a
    consequence which enabled him to accomplish some of his most amazing
    feats—was his skill in composition. His training in draftsmanship
    gave him the power to render exactly all details that contribute
    to individuality of character, and the simultaneous training in
    composition taught him how to arrange immense numbers of such
    individualized figures without loss of mass unity. Was it the Alpine
    mountain-sides or merely the upper window of a house on a village
    square that suggested to him the device of a slightly elevated
    viewpoint? It is this more than anything else that enables him
    to impose upon his multitudes that order of art by which may be
    expressed the disorder of life; and it is this that gives him his long
    perspectives of village streets or far horizons dominated by oblique
    lines. These last, starkly visible at first and gradually becoming more
    broken and concealed, constitute the characteristic mark of Bruegel the
    designer.</p>

  <p>But it is in design that there is to be discerned the least amount
    of technical advance on Bruegel’s part; what he learned before he
    began to paint seems to have come nearer to sufficing him in design
    than in drawing or in color. His composition scheme in the set of the
    <a href="#i_48"><cite>Months</cite></a> is shockingly, though intentionally, repetitious; in the
    hands of a less vigorous artist it must quickly have become the deadest
    recipe. He divides his panel into two practically equal parts by a bold
    diagonal from one upper corner to the opposite lower one; one of these
    parts he fills with things and people seen close at hand, and the other
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>with a far-spreading panorama. And he does it five times over with
    such freshness that doing it seven times more does not seem beyond his
    powers. But the design remains a pattern, conceived in the same way as
    the large composite landscapes done soon after his return from Rome.</p>

    <figcaption>THE MAGPIE ON THE GALLOWS. &nbsp; &nbsp;1568. &nbsp; &nbsp;DARMSTADT, MUSEUM</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>In drawing and color, on the other hand, the <a href="#i_48"><cite>Months</cite></a> show a
    marked departure from earlier habits in the direction of an essentially
    modern practice. In the drawing as such there is an increase in
    looseness with no loss of surety; tightness is sacrificed, but not
    precision. The figures are still silhouettes to a great extent, but
    there is an approach to the coalescence of color and drawing. In color
    by itself there is ever an opposition of large areas of some shade of
    brown and some shade of green, and a weaving of these areas together
    by bits of each color in the other and of other colors in both. Though
    there is never the full impressionistic fusing of edges in atmosphere,
    there is yet a decided approximation to the vision of a genuinely
    naturalistic landscape painter, as distinguished from the vision of a
    draftsman or a miniaturist.</p>

  <p>While this is true, and must be accounted to Bruegel as a merit, an
    evidence of mental and technical growth, it is still in a measure
    unfair to the never-failing largeness and unity of vision in the
    earlier work. Whether the other qualities of this work be regarded as
    merits or defects in themselves depends, of course, upon the technical
    tenets or preferences of him who makes the judgment. But in Bruegel
    they were neither merits nor defects; they were characteristics which
    had to <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a><a id="Page_43"></a>43</span>be present in his pictures if he painted at all. They were
    necessitated by the time in which he lived and by his professional
    practice previous to painting. They were as much a part of him as his
    fondness for telling stories; and in the fluctuations of taste stranger
    things have already happened than would be the return of even this
    latter element to professional as well as popular favor.</p>

  <h3>6.</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap-s"><span class="smcap1">In</span> Bruegel’s time story-telling in pictures generally was still one
    of the principal means of communicating ideas—even, perhaps mainly,
    ideas that were not inherently pictorial; prints were still the nearest
    things to books in popular circulation. Moreover, a nation living
    under the necessity of never speaking out openly on either politics
    or religion naturally resorted to symbol, the concrete proverb or the
    image that said one thing and meant another. The print of the big and
    little fish not only meant that the great oppressed the small but
    carried an idea beyond the words of the proverb in showing the big fish
    ripped up and disgorging; and upon a people so apt at interpreting
    images the significance of that would not be lost. This people could
    not only take a hearty enjoyment of the good things of life but they
    could also face the whole of it without shrinking from any part of it,
    whether of grossness or of terror. For the latter, indeed, they even
    had a gusto and the former they laughed away with a saving healthiness.
    The distinguishing mark of their living and their thinking was a robust
    realism.</p>

  <p>In Pieter Bruegel there emerged from among them a man of genius in
    complete sympathy with their realistic attitude towards life; knowing
    it from childhood, he gave it in his art a more complete expression
    than it had ever had before. The whole originality and fertility of
    his mind were for long expended upon feeding the popular taste not
    only for the familiar or exotic beauty of nature but also for a rough
    philosophy, unorganized but none the less genuine; and a habit so well
    established in him by years of labor would not vanish all at once
    even when more purely painter-like interests assumed for him a major
    importance. His predecessors in painting had been realistic in their
    measure; in them, however, realism was largely confined to details of
    execution and was more than counterbalanced by markedly idealistic
    conceptions. Even in the grotesqueries of Bosch the older disparity
    between idea and embodiment existed; the diabolism in them was only
    the obverse of the conventional religious idealism, and its distance
    from a true realism of content remained the same. When Bruegel came
    to painting, he both carried the manner of realism farther than his
    predecessors had done and informed that manner with its appropriately
    realistic matter, bringing about a new harmony between the body and the
    spirit of the art. He became the first complete realist in the history
    of painting.</p>

    <img src="images/i_46.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>MARINE. &nbsp; &nbsp;VIENNA, MUSEUM</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The <a href="#i_18"><cite>Fall of the Rebel Angels</cite></a> is the nearest thing to a
    rule-proving exception among Bruegel’s great works, the single one
    which exhibits any of the older disparity between container and
    content; and this picture, great as it is, could vanish without
    impairing in the least Bruegel’s essential greatness. To examine
    the Berlin <a href="#i_16"><cite>Proverbs</cite></a> in detail is to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>get a feeling of being
    among mad folks because so many of the sayings here illustrated turn
    upon outlandish actions; but as a picture it is a piece of masterly
    realistic sanity showing a whole village, in which some of the
    inhabitants happen to be crazy, intensely busy about its own affairs.
    The <a href="#i_29"><cite>Triumph of Death</cite></a>, so far from being a piece of wild and
    gross fancy, is actually the lucid statement of an idea as true as
    any gesture in the picture; it is precisely the relentlessness of its
    realism in thought as well as in embodiment which frightens people into
    calling it untrue. The latter two paintings only show that if an artist
    is realist enough, if he penetrates sufficiently into the actual, he
    necessarily becomes imaginative; they only reiterate and strengthen
    Bruegel’s right to be considered the supreme realist in painting.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Part of his realism is his refusal to depict what he did not feel.
    Only once did he venture upon any of the religious emotionalism that
    had played so large a part in the work of his predecessors, and then
    he found the emotion so foreign to his own feelings that he openly
    borrowed the imagery of it; in relation to the great panoramic realism
    of the <a href="#i_23"><cite>Carrying of the Cross</cite></a>, the group of mourning women
    remains a mere formalism, dissociated in spirit and in manner from
    all about it. Jesus himself is simply an unfortunate creature whose
    approaching execution is the pretext for this holiday. What passes for
    the conversion of Paul might be the delusion of a man knocked in the
    head on falling from a shying horse; there is about the event none of
    the conventional supernaturalism because for Bruegel that sort of thing
    was not real. The religious subject as such disappears from his work;
    and this, coming after <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a><a id="Page_49"></a>49</span>the ecstatic idealisms of his predecessors,
    amounts to the expression of an idea concerning the significance—or
    lack of it—inherent in the churchly religion. He will have nothing
    to do with what is not human; not even nature enters into the great
    paintings except as a setting that enhances, by sympathy or contrast,
    the emotional life of human beings. To these, whom he knows and loves,
    Bruegel gives himself wholly, to share in their sorrows and their joys.
    His religion is that of the great humanists in all ages, and his faith
    is given only to life itself.</p>

  <p>Part of his realism is the robust laughter which is the only solution
    for the fix in which human beings find themselves. It is the spirit
    that animated Rabelais in describing the birth of his hero and
    Shakespeare in creating Falstaff. To come closer home to Bruegel,
    perhaps, it is the spirit of <cite>Till Eulenspiegel</cite>, whose gross
    pleasanteries were probably relished by the painter along with the
    rest of his generation. Bruegel’s passion for completeness in his
    realism abolishes privacy, and the state of affairs brought to pass by
    this slicing away of all walls is saved only by humor. Humor is the
    safety-valve for a spirit resolute to probe life to its last refuge—to
    probe life, but not to break through by main force, as attempted by
    later realists so-called.</p>

    <img src="images/i_50.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>HUNTERS IN THE SNOW (FEBRUARY?). &nbsp; &nbsp;VIENNA, MUSEUM</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Another element in Bruegel’s realism is the objectivity of his work.
    Van Mander’s anecdote already quoted shows that Bruegel went <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a><a id="Page_51"></a>51</span>among
    the peasants, not as a professional artist in search of material, but
    as a participator in their life; and the great pictures themselves
    strikingly bear this out. This is not to say that Bruegel never worked
    directly from life, for there are many drawings which could not have
    been done otherwise—a team of horses resting, soldiers standing in the
    way, old market-women squatting beside their wares. But when he came to
    paint the great pictures, Bruegel worked from a memory stocked with the
    gestures and actions of people who are unconscious of being watched.
    Bruegel’s mind was centered upon their life and he was concerned with
    technic hardly beyond the point where it would enable him to crowd
    all their life into his given space and shape. His concentration upon
    the story he was telling, from the encyclopedic narrative of the
    early works to the simple and straightforward emotionalism of the
    <a href="#i_48"><cite>Months</cite></a>, put him on the crest of a wave of energy which carried
    him through many an undertaking that would have been impossible for a
    more self-conscious man. We who see the pictures now are unconscious
    of the painter because he was himself lost in his subject; and because
    of this, also, we are unconscious of ourselves. “No glance ever strays
    across the footlights to the audience,” wrote Meier-Graefe of Hogarth’s
    scenes. In Bruegel’s work there are no actors, no footlights and no
    audience. There is only life and participation in life by painter and
    by us.</p>

  <p>And everywhere in these pictures it is the life of Bruegel’s own
    time. His predecessors had clothed religious themes in contemporary
    dress, but the outer and the inner remained separate things; Bruegel,
    retaining the outer, put into it its own proper content. He ousted
    religious stories by contemporary stories. These he painted so
    completely that a thorough sociological knowledge of the age might be
    founded upon or tested by his pictures. The whole life of the time is
    set down by a hand that never falsifies, that swerves neither to the
    right of idealization nor to the left of caricature.</p>

  <p>Yet to leave him as a painter of contemporary manners only would be
    almost as false to his greatness as to consider him only as Bruegel the
    Droll. For he penetrates below the temporary appearances of his time to
    the permanent in human nature. His pictures can be a means of access
    to the life of his age, to be sure; but no lover of them would think
    of using them in this fashion. The important thing is that they give
    access to a life that is of more than one age; under the costume of the
    time exists the same humanity that now wears another dress.</p>

  <p>In giving himself over so unreservedly to the impermanent, Bruegel took
    what was for him the only way to the permanent. This cannot be captured
    by going out after a vague and unlocalized something called life in
    general; what is presented to the artist for his use is always life in
    particular. There is an all-life in the steady and swelling succession
    of human generations; but the only means of access to that is the
    now-life. The great artist’s major accomplishment lies in revealing the
    universal through the particular, the permanent through the transitory,
    the inevitable through the accidental.</p>

  <p>This Bruegel does; and how well he does it is to be found by analyzing
    the thought behind his varied rendering of events and people. Even in
    his early pictures each creature has his own individuality and yet is
    part of the crowd, which remains a crowd in spite of all detail; each
    individual retains his own value of personality and yet is integrated
    into a collective being. Bruegel’s minute accuracy of drawing expresses
    his love for the individual as such; his great masses of people express
    his desire to see life largely and as an interwoven whole. Moreover,
    the device of making the ostensible subject of a picture an almost
    invisible incident in it is an expression of an idea as to the relative
    importance of the individual and what happens to him. Though the
    actions of the <a href="#i_23"><cite>Carrying of the Cross</cite></a> and the <a href="#i_37"><cite>Conversion of
    Paul</cite></a> do actually center around the subject-incident, the incident
    itself is reduced almost to the vanishing-point; so that the story
    emphasis is thrown entirely upon the larger life of which the incident
    is only the temporary focus. The <a href="#i_36"><cite>Fall of Icarus</cite></a> likewise
    expresses this heresy <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a><a id="Page_53"></a>53</span>against conventional thinking as to what is
    truly sublime; only here the unimportance of a particular event is made
    more emphatic by such a detail as the position of the shepherd as well
    as by the large indifference of this great luminous calm expanse of
    land and sea and sky.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Moreover, the sequence of changes in the relative importance of the
    human figures in the paintings is but the story of Bruegel’s developing
    conception of the relative importance of man in the scheme of things.
    In one group of pictures the individual, though fully personalized, is
    a part of the crowd and the crowd a mass of insects swarming over the
    landscape. In another group of large-figured peasant subjects man is
    all-important, filling the whole and shutting nature out. The former
    are amazing, and one can hardly get too much of them; the latter are
    interesting and one likes them long. But for the final expression of
    his mind one must turn to the set of the <a href="#i_48"><cite>Months</cite></a>; these five,
    with the addition of the <a href="#i_37"><cite>Paul</cite></a> and the <a href="#i_36"><cite>Icarus</cite></a>, form the
    summit of Bruegel’s art. In them Bruegel reached the solution of the
    two problems of his life, the life of nature and the life of man; and
    the solution was the life of man in nature.</p>

  <p>The <a href="#i_48"><cite>Months</cite></a> sum up his life’s endeavor both in the material
    he had all along been dealing with and in the conceptions between
    which all along he had been alternating. They are full of motives and
    incidents taken from his earlier works—the church he drew so often,
    children at their games, the great stretches of landscape that he
    loved. But all things are adjusted to one another in a new way; the
    people are seen neither too large nor too small, but in a perfect
    relationship to <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a><a id="Page_55"></a><a id="Page_56"></a>56</span>an immensely embracing nature; and each picture is
    pervaded by an unbroken harmony of mood. This set marks the attainment
    of final insight into everything that had concerned him; they
    constitute his acceptance and affirmation of life.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap-s"><span class="smcap1">The</span> more Bruegel’s work is studied the stronger grows the feeling that
    almost everything may be attributed to him. To go to Vienna and through
    that group of fifteen pictures to come into direct contact with his
    mind across three hundred and fifty years is to be convinced that his
    is one of the inexhaustible minds of the world. The material brilliancy
    of the painting is more than matched by the brilliancy of the creative
    soul behind them. Whether he himself was conscious of all that can now
    be perceived in his work does not much matter; whether it came there
    with him aware or unaware, it is enough to make him superbly great. But
    this much is true: the more his mind is apprehended, the more vast and
    purposeful it appears.</p>

  <p>He was fortunate in finding his means of expression in what was then
    a popular art; everything about that art was so alive that it drew
    to itself some of the greatest minds of the time. There existed a
    tremendous amount of give-and-take between the artist and his age, and
    this degree of interaction it was which had most to do with endowing
    both art and artist with vitality; they were fed from sources outside
    of and larger than themselves. Thus it was that Bruegel attained to so
    comprehensive an expression of himself and his age together that his
    work has become one of the permanent things of art.</p>

  <p>Each picture is a completely functioning organism with several
    different aspects. There is the aspect of story-telling, that of
    technical picture-making and that of philosophic thought. Each aspect
    functions harmoniously with the others. Not only can one analyze out at
    will the elements proper to each aspect, but one can move from one to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a><a id="Page_58"></a>58</span>another without any feeling of shifting gear or changing speed. (The
    one exception is the group of mourning women in the <a href="#i_23"><cite>Carrying of the
    Cross</cite></a>.) All these aspects function at the same mental rate. They
    are all interwoven into powerful wholes. Every picture is a world in
    itself, and coming to know them is one of the completest experiences
    that can be found anywhere in the art of painting.</p>

    <figcaption>THE RETURN OF THE HERDS (DETAIL)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Yet even with this completeness of expression attained, one has before
    Bruegel’s work a feeling of still more behind, an immensity of mind
    larger than any art can be. It is the feeling one has before Michelangelo,
    but not before Raphael; before Shakespeare, but not before
    Marlowe. The greater ones are not only greater in their art, but they
    have something left over in themselves which their art suggests but
    does not directly express. Of this greater company is Pieter Bruegel.</p>

  <p>There are purer painters, but for the purity of their art they pay
    the price of going without something of importance to a complete
    life. And even their gain in intensity seems hardly a gain in the
    face of Bruegel’s intensity on all the levels of his completeness.
    He transposes all life into his pictures in a scale of relative
    relationship that preserves the values of human life itself. Every
    other painter lacks something or has something in excess. Bruegel is
    the most comprehensive and the best balanced, the most energetic and
    the mellowest. Of all painters he is the greatest realist, and of them
    all the most humane.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap-s"><span class="smcap1">The</span> object of the following book-list is to mention not everything
    that has been printed about Pieter Bruegel but only such volumes and
    articles as have definite value. The major cause of its shortness,
    however, is the fact that the literature of the subject is surprisingly
    small in quantity; in English, particularly, there is almost nothing
    beyond short paragraphs in some histories of art and the usual
    unilluminating brevities of general reference works.</p>

    Van Bastelaer</span> et <span class="smcap">Georges Hulin De Loo</span>. Bruxelles: G.
    Van Oest &amp; Cie.: 1907.</p>

  <p>This, the first volume to be published on Bruegel, remains the standard
    work. For the handsomeness and completeness of its reproductions
    combined with the accuracy and thoroughness of its text, treating every
    aspect of the painter’s life and work, it is a notable accomplishment
    in book-making and in scholarship. What has since been written and
    the pictures that have since been discovered still do no more than
    supplement certain phases of it; nor can it be superseded until someone
    is prepared to give time and money to a thorough search of European
    galleries and private collections. It is now, however, somewhat
    difficult to obtain.</p>

    Bastelaer</span>. Bruxelles: G. Van Oest &amp; Cie.: 1908.</p>

  <p>Within its chosen field this volume also remains the standard and needs
    only supplementing by later researches. Its 278 plates reproduce all
    the prints then thought to be by Bruegel or after his designs.</p>

  <p>This, which appeared immediately after the two preceding volumes, may
    fairly be described as a good popularization of them, with additional
    historical material drawn from other sources. The thirty reproductions
    are very good half-tones; the text gives a satisfactory account of the
    painter’s life and times, although there is too much reliance upon the
    mere subject-matter of the pictures and although parts of Van Mander’s
    clumsy narrative are transposed into French of debatable suavity. It is
    the only generally available biography in French. To any reader of it
    my indebtedness to it for facts (other than those given by Van Mander)
    and my occasional difference of interpretation will be equally evident.</p>

  <p>This is commended by Herr Friedländer (see eighth item) as a portrait
    of the man Bruegel; as a discussion of his work, however, it has been
    superseded in German by Herr Friedländer’s own book.</p>

  <p>The fact that these two articles ostensibly deal each with a single
    picture should not obscure either their general interest or their
    significance as indications and instruments of the contemporary
    tendency to assign to Bruegel a higher rank than he has had heretofore.</p>

  <p>The main point of interest about Bruegel in this book is that the
    author gives a catalogue of paintings which differs considerably, both
    in its omissions and in its additions, from that given by <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Hulin (see

  <p>This is the standard general work in German, and contains a trustworthy
    translation of the entire text of Van Mander concerning Bruegel. Even
    those who do not read German might well possess this book for the
    clearness and frequent brilliancy of its 101 half-tone reproductions,
    the majority of which are from drawings and prints. Herr Friedländer is
    the only continental scholar so far whose work takes cognizance of the
    picture now in the Metropolitan Museum.</p>

  <p>This author’s habitual saturation with his subject-matter has enabled
    him to convey the multitudinous quality to be felt in many of Bruegel’s
    pictures and also to adumbrate the humanity of soul behind them; but
    he has almost nothing to say about the more narrowly æsthetic merits
    which permit of Bruegel being ranked among the great; and even on the
    score of subject-matter Bruegel’s livingness is almost smothered under
    a rhetoric made sluggish with anecdotal detail.</p>

  <p>This essay is a little sermon on the virtue of comprehensiveness in the
    appreciation of art, with Bruegel as an ideal text. It is not itself
    a comprehensive presentation of the painter or his work and it has
    very few traces of the verbal brilliancy which has had so much to do
    with putting this author’s novels in the best-selling class; but it
    may make the name of Bruegel known to many who are not in a position
    to penetrate his work on their own account. I note a curious slip
    in the transposition of titles between the Brussels <a href="#i_32"><cite>Numbering at

  <p class="drop-cap-s"><span class="smcap1">The</span> illustrations of Bruegel’s paintings accompanying this article are
    confined to those accepted as authentic by <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Hulin in his catalogue
    (see Bibliography, first item), with certain additional ones discovered
    since its publication. Seventeen of the paintings are positively dated;
    the rest must be distributed through the eleven years of painting on
    other evidence. Wherever a date appears under an illustration, it is
    the one assigned by the authority just mentioned, with the exceptions
    noted. The only alteration in the chronological order, so far as that
    may be determined, has been the grouping of the <a href="#i_48"><cite>Months</cite></a> at the
    end, to correspond with the text, in which they are treated as the
    summing-up of Bruegel’s work as a painter. All the drawings reproduced
    are dated on the authority of Herr Tolnai (see Bibliography, fourteenth
    item). The following paragraphs give certain supplementary facts:</p>

  <p><a href="#i_10"><cite>Village Marriage</cite></a>: Two copies by Pieter <abbr title="second">II</abbr> are known. A
    comparison of this picture with them shows that the arm and hand of the
    man kneeling near the bottom of the stairway have been repainted “for
    reasons of decency”!</p>

  <p><a href="#i_11"><cite>Dancing Peasant</cite></a>: This is doubtful. Herr Friedländer considers it
    a copy; <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Hulin leaves the matter undetermined, but reproduces it.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_15"><cite>Descent of Christ into Limbo</cite></a> (drawing): Herr Tolnai says that
    the date and signature are apocryphal, but assigns it to no other year.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_16"><cite>Flemish Proverbs</cite></a>: Not known to <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Hulin; date given on the
    authority of Herr Friedländer.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_19"><cite>Battle Between the Israelites and the Philistines</cite></a>: also called
    <cite>The Death of Saul at the Battle of Gilboa</cite>. The uncertainty
    of this date turns upon whether an extra figure can or can not be
    discerned at the end of the Roman numerals.</p>

    Terrible Margaret, she who frightens the devil himself.</p>

    achievement.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_38"><cite>The Wine of Saint Martin</cite></a>: Admitted by <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Hulin, but with strong

    Bruegel to his wife.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_46"><cite>Marine</cite></a>: Not dated by <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Hulin. Placed here because it appears to
    be unfinished, and so possibly very late.</p>

  <p><a href="#i_48"><cite>The Months</cite></a>: The months suggested in the titles given under the
    illustrations follow <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Hulin’s catalogue. Herr Friedländer assigns
    that given as January to March, the February to December, the August
    (New York) to July, leaving the other two as given.</p>

  <p><abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Hulin dates the whole set about 1567. The only trace among them of a
    date is on the picture in the Metropolitan Museum; on the strength of
    this Herr Friedländer assigns it positively to 1565, but Mr. Burroughs
    is inclined to agree with <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Hulin. In any case the violation of time
    order in placing this set last is not very great and the gain is
    considerable in giving a culminating impression of Bruegel’s art.</p>

  <h3>2.</h3>

  <p>No paintings in Bruegel’s manner are reproduced which are definitely or
    even probably by the sons. They are a multitude in themselves, and are
    mostly attributed to the father. They are to be met with everywhere,
    from London to Palermo, from Madrid to Petrograd. Herr Friedländer
    authenticates (without reproducing) one in Budapest and another in
    Csàkány. In Hampton Court Palace there is an extremely interesting
    smaller version of the Vienna <a href="#i_33"><cite>Massacre of the Innocents</cite></a> in which
    eatables are substituted for most of the children, and a companion
    piece of coarser workmanship giving an entirely different picture of a
    massacre. In Vienna there are a dozen or more by the sons which throw
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>much light on the entire question of Bruegel’s own pictures; the most
    interesting of these is in the Lichtenstein Collection and is in the
    manner of the <cite>Fleeing Shepherd</cite> in Philadelphia. The problems
    raised by all these pictures are many and complex, but the scope and
    intention of this essay did not permit of its touching upon such
    matters. However, there are all sorts of ways to spend life, and not
    the least interesting way would be to go a-Bruegeling through Europe.</p>

    <p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> ARTS is not exclusively a magazine of modern art or
      exclusively a magazine of the art of the past. It is solely a magazine
      of art, whenever or wherever produced.</p>

    <p>Its text is intelligent, stimulating and readable, and the essays which
      appear in its pages are permanent contributions to the literature of
      art. In selecting its writers <cite class="smcap">The Arts</cite> endeavors to secure
      those who are authorities on their particular subjects but are also
      capable of writing freshly and directly about them—who are not so
      engrossed by the historical and archæological side of art as to forget
      its supreme æsthetic importance.</p>

    <p>In its essays on the art of the past <cite class="smcap">The Arts</cite> does not confine
      itself within the conventional limits of the European tradition, but
      recognizes in the art of the Orient, of Africa, or of aboriginal
      America the same qualities which exist in the art of the West.</p>

    <p>In its treatment of contemporary art, <cite class="smcap">The Arts</cite> attempts
      to present the work of the most vital artists of the present day,
      whether radical or conservative, the emphasis being placed not on the
      particular group or faction to which the artist may belong, but upon
      the work itself.</p>

    <p>Realizing that one of the most important functions of a magazine is the
      discovery of new talent, <cite class="smcap">The Arts</cite> has always opened its pages
      to the work of the most promising of the younger artists. Its policy is
      not to wait until an artist has achieved success, but to be ahead of
      the crowd in affording recognition to the talented men of the future.</p>

    <p>Its regular departments, such as reviews of current exhibitions
      and new art books, keep its readers informed of the significant
      developments in the world of art. Although the bulk of its articles are
      devoted to painting, sculpture, architecture and the decorative arts,
      <cite class="smcap">The Arts</cite> from time to time publishes essays in the fields of
      music, drama or literature which it knows will be of interest to its
      readers—particularly on the subjects of stage design and the art of the
      films.</p>

    <p>The written word, however, cannot convey all of the significance of a
      work of art. For that reason it has been the policy of the magazine
      to make of each issue a series of illustrations which no artist or
      art lover can afford to be without. Every number of <cite class="smcap">The Arts</cite>
      contains fifty to sixty excellently printed reproductions of important
      works of art of the past or the present.</p>
